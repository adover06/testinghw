## Question 1) Define the following unit, integration, regression tests and when you would use each?
- Unit test: Unit testing is where the individual functions are isolated when testing. This type of test focuses on the individual tests at a time.  
- Integration test: The integration test is when the smaller components of a larger system are put togeather (integrated) and then tested.
- Regression test: A regression test is when the prior code is tested after a new feature/new code is added. This is done to ensure that the new code doesn't affect the old code in a way that would break it.
## Question 2) Briefly explain pytest discovery (file/function naming) and what a fixture is.
Pytest discovery is a testing framework for python. A fixture in pytest is a sort of reusable test definition before the test definition that is used in the test. The way pytest finds your tests is buy searchign for the files and fucntions that start/end with "test".
